# SuperMarioBros
Yet another Super Mario Bros. (NES) clone.

Libraries : SFML, spdlog.

This is a side project I created to improve my C++.

Compatibilities : x86, x64.

How to make it run on your local repo :

Simply clone the project and launch it with Visual Studio 19. All external libraries are included in the project, and every dependencies are set relative to the root folder of the solution.
